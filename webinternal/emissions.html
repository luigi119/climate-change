            <h2>Carbon Emissions</h2>
            <p>The last significant impact on climate change we will discuss on the earth is Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions. CO2 emissions are greenhouse gases and are often associated with the burning of fossil fuels, like natural gas, crude oil and coal. These gases are released into the atmosphere and contribute towards global warming, as they are trapped in the atmosphere. New Zealand’s net greenhouse gas emissions increased by 54% between 1990 and 2014. Globally, this statistic has increased so significantly it's hard to believe. Since 1900, fossil fuels have increased by almost 10 times what they were, and if a change isn’t made soon, this drastically increasing number will continue increasing.   Zealand is believed to contribute around 1.74 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, while bigger countries such as the United States and China produce 394.98 billion tonnes and 194.9 billion tonnes. These increases are having significant changes on our earth with many side effects coming. Long term will be even more devastating. Something has to be done as fast as possible before these changes become irreversible. What are some solutions to this growing problem?</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            As humanity, who lives on the earth, a very significant problem is our Carbon Dioxide emissions that are emitted into our atmosphere. This significant problem is having serious effects on global warming and will have vast long term damage on the earth we call home. However, we are lucky that there are solutions that can be accomplished, varying from individual change to countrywide change which will have significant impacts on the future for humanity.

           <h1>Solutions to Carbon Dioxide Emissions</h1>
<p>
        <b>1.More efficient transportation.</b> By using more efficient transportation you reduce your personal footprint. Try using public transportation, such as buses, and carpooling with others. By doing this you reduce your personal footprint and these can carry multiple people who would usually have personal transportation and this effects the environment more. By using public transportation you reduce your own footprint. Walking and cycling also produce no carbon, so these are both the most efficient ways to lower your carbon footprint. Flying produces lots of carbon, with around 2.5% of the worlds carbon production coming from airlines. Flying less will decrease your carbon footprint. Ultimately, these tips all reduce carbon production and limit the carbon dioxide emissions into our atmosphere<br>
    <b>2.Better living habits.</b> At home, very slight and small changes can have a difference on our carbon footprints. Anything from turning the lights off when they are on unnecessarily, line drying clothes, planting a small garden and eating organic foods significantly reduce your power usage and aim to reduce your carbon footprint. Small changes in everyday life have a very significant difference. Other small actions that will help lower your footprint can be not using air-conditioning as much, using reusable bags when shopping, and driving less by using more public transport such as buses.<br>
    <b>3.Shopping with reduced carbon footprints.</b> Even little changes like who you shop with can have significant decreases on your carbon footprint. If you shop with companies that wish to decrease their own carbon footprint, as it is a more efficient way of reducing your own footprint as well as supporting companies that wish to lower theirs. By shopping with companies that have awareness and care for the environment you show that you care too, and a change in mindset is significant. 
    <b>4.Spreading awareness.</b> By changing your lifestyle, it will influence others to do the same. By following these solutions, you share a message of change, a message that you want to do whatever you can to stop the problem. By sharing this message you create awareness and others will want to help out and change their lifestyle. The more people who change their lifestyle to lower their carbon footprint, the more significant the positive impacts will be.
