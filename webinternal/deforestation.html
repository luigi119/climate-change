            <h2><u>Deforestation Facts</u></h2>
            <p>
                Deforestation is becoming an increasingly significant problem in the 21st century and is having a greater influence on climate change. It is estimated that 15,000,000,000 trees are cut down annually, and estimated values of around 20-50 football fields worth of trees are lost every minute. 30% of the earth's land mass is occupied by forests, and despite the cutting down of trees for many purposes has been something that has happened for centuries, the demand for deforestation has radically increased in the last 50 years. Experts believe at the current rate of deforestation, the earth will be without trees by 2300. Trees play a significant role in the survival of the human race, taking in carbon dioxide and producing oxygen which is breathed by humans, as well as improving air quality, supporting wildlife, conserving water and preserving soil. Without trees, humanity would not be able to live on earth due to unsuitable air for breathing, lack of absorption of carbon dioxide, as well as serious lacks in food, water and animals. Deforestation is a significant problem that will have a serious long term effect on the world and humanity, so it is important to address the problem now and stop the problem before it is too late. How do we do that?

            <h2><u>Deforestation Solutions</u></h2>
            <p>
                <b>1. </b> With the demand for trees growing ever higher every year, it is important that we start countering it as soon as possible so that this issue can be managed and maintained. As individuals, in local communities and the world in general, we can make a small but impactful difference in the long term.
                As individuals, a massive way to help the problem is by researching deforestation and finding companies that work towards eradicating the problem and donating to them. A small amount of money may not seem like much, but if more and more people continue to donate small sums, they will contribute highly in the long term.
                <br>
                <b>2.</b>
                In local communities, research around or go in search of environmental groups or clubs that offer solutions to deforestation problems. These groups may offer opportunities such as tree-planting, which will contribute greatly in the long term towards anti-deforestation. Small actions such as these will have positive effects on local communities, and the more people who join the larger the movement will become and further emphasis on the problems with deforestation will be highlighted, and the more popular problems such as deforestation become, the more action will be taken.
                <br>
                <b>3. </b>
                As a human race in general, we have to do more to emphasize our feelings towards deforestation. Thankfully, deforestation has become a serious concern and has gained movement all over the world. Striking against unhelpful things is one way, as striking or protesting is a great way to get attention from governments or companies in forestry industries. Again, donations too big companies make big impacts on what they can do to help. Overall, supporting the movements against deforestation are among the best ways to do your part against the problem, helping others gain awareness on the issue is also an important part of getting rid of the problem and creating a better future for the earth.
