            <h2>Pollution</h2>
            <p>Another significant contributing factor to the current rate of climate change in the 21st Century is the large amounts of pollution and wastes that are misplaced every year. It is estimated within 6 months of purchase, 99% of what we buy is trashed. Facts like this are massive contributors to the estimated 2,120,000,000 tonnes of waste we as humans produce annually. The average person is believed to contribute 0.74kg of waste daily, and with the growth of the earth's population continuing to rise, these numbers are only expected to rise. There are many different types of pollution, but three of the most significant pollution types that are having the greatest effect on climate change are land pollution, water pollution and air pollution. Air pollution is the measure of chemical, biological or physical pollutants in the air, which eventually get trapped in the atmosphere, contributing greatly towards climate change and global warming. Water pollution is the contamination of any form of water which therefore affects its quality and makes it toxic for the environment and humans. Contamination of water with waste is affecting natural and environment in the sea as well as changing the seas climate which further contributes towards climate change. Land pollution is the destruction and contamination of the earth's surface due to humans direct and indirect impacts, which impacts the environment, animals and humans themselves.</p>

            <h2>Air Pollution Solutions</h2>
            <p>To find a solution to air pollution, there are a few different ways that will have positive impacts as both an individual and collectively in the human race. If we resolve these solutions and add them to our modern day lives, we could prevent air pollution and improve our air quality. All 3 of the solutions will have positive impacts both short-term and long-term. <br>
                1.Using renewable fuel and clean energy. Perhaps the most basic solution, by lowering our use of fossil fuels we decrease our emissions into the atmosphere and decrease our contributions towards global warming. Instead of using fossil fuels, we can switch to alternative energy sources, such as solar, wind and geothermal. <br>
                2.Eco-friendly transportation. It starts with the promotion of sharing vehicles and transportation. By taking buses and carpooling, you reduce your individual pollution as you and other people produce the same amount as you would individually. If you look to go bigger, shifting to electric and hydrogen vehicles also reduce air pollution due to their lack of fossil fuels that they produce. <br>
                3.Being efficient with our use of energy and being conservative. Reducing our consumption of energy has positive effects on the environment. We can reduce our energy consumption by looking closely at our consumption and finding ways to efficiently improve our habits and make them more responsible.

            <h2>Water Pollution</h2>
            <p>
                <b>1.Reducing plastic consumption.</b> The ocean has a very large amount of plastic in it, its estimated between 4.8-12.7 billion tonnes of plastic is dumped into the ocean annually. To reduce this amount of plastic, we as a human race must improve our use of plastic waste. Many companies worldwide are stopping using plastic products, but to stop this worldwide problem and reduce plastic in the water, we must cut down on our plastic usage significantly.<br>
                <b>2.Wastewater treatment.</b> This consists of removing pollutants from wastewater that is destined for the water. To do this consists of physical, biological or chemical processes. The more efficient these processes are the cleaner the water becomes.</p>
            <b>3.Air pollution prevention.</b> An estimated 25% of human-created carbon dioxide emissions are absorbed by our oceans. This pollution is happening at such a fast rate that the ocean is rapidly acidifying. This change in the ocean threatens a lot of marine life and coral. To prevent this, the best way is to look at the solutions above for air pollution. <br>

            <h2>Land Pollution</h2>
            <p>


                <b>1.Recycling.</b> It is extremely important that we do the simplest things, as this can make the biggest difference. Recycling reuses our waste in a way that is healthy for the environment and helps reduce the amount of waste produced, by instead reusing what has already been produced. This is a significant way of reducing land pollution as it decreases waste production. <br>
                <b>2.Proper waste disposal.</b> By disposing of waste in the most efficient way possible and treating it and disposing of it in the safest way possible, this reduces the amount of waste that ends up on land and ultimately has brighter long term and short term futures. <br>
                <b>3.Joining eco-groups. </b>This is a more difficult solution to follow and may not be available for many people, however by joining eco-groups designated to reducing waste and cleaning up rubbish, we have reduced waste as well as spread awareness about the issue of pollution. This can also be done as individuals in the case of no groups being able to join, but ultimately every piece of rubbish picked up may seem insignificant, but has a significant difference in long term futures of the earth. By doing so, you create awareness and the message gets spread around to other people as well, so you encourage others to do more for their community as well.
